# Simple Journal

A simple Bullet Journal. 

In a nut shell the Simple Journal consists of a series of bullet point lists. Items in a list are marked with a status. 

- `X` (completed)
- `>` (for tomorrow) 
- `<` (save for later)
- and a few others 

When making a new entry items from the list marked `>` (for later) are moved to the next entry list. 

Imagine an entry as a list of daily todos and reminders. And items being items in an entry list. 

The app uses React for View managment and Redux for state management. The app persists data using local storage. All of the data will be saved on the device where they were created and will reappear each time you open the app. 

## Todo

- Post to Github Pages
- Move list of Entries to left column
- Add styles 
- ~~Adding an entry should grab the Items with status `>`~~
- ~~New Entry button functional~~
- ~~Remove Add Entry section at top~~
- ~~Use Local Storage~~
